Program Translator.py is intended for translating texts in selected file
from one language to another (according to the user choice) using customized
database. I am using my own database called 'projects'.
The second part of the program enables manual translation of remaining
sentences in the file and updating the database. There is sql and txt file
called "dictionary" attached. These files have been used as sample database.
Attached Txt file called "testfile" have been used as a sample file to be translated.
This program is still developing.
